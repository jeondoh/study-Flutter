# The macOS deployment target ‘MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET’ is set to 10.11, but the range of supported deployment target versions is 10.13 to 13.1.99

When installing certain plugins (e.g. Firestore) that require a minimum deployment target that is **higher** than the one set in the Xcode project, this issue can appear:

```
The macOS deployment target ‘MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET’ is set to 10.11, but the range of supported deployment target versions is 10.13 to 13.1.99
```

To address this, open the macOS project and set the minimum deployment target as needed:

It's also a good idea to have the **same** target in the `Podfile` (first line at the top):

```ruby
platform :osx, '10.14'
```

> Note: Since Flutter 3.7, the minimum macOS version supported by Flutter increases to **10.14 Mojave**.
